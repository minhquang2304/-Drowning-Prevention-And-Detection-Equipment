# This is my highschool project to detect drowning using machine learning model on edge device

The software is meant to be run on a ESP32 with BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) 

To use the software you first have to download the machine learning library called project-1-arduino-1.0.5.zip and include it in the main program.
